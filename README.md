# StackExchangeRAG

An information retrieval and generation system that leverages the **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) framework** to provide relevant answers by retrieving similar responses from **StackExchange datasets** and synthesizing them into coherent outputs.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project integrates **FAISS** (for efficient similarity search) and **LangChain** (for orchestration of retrieval and generation) to build a lightweight Q&A engine.  
Given a query, the system retrieves semantically relevant answers from StackExchange and uses a language model to generate a final response.

## ðŸ§© Key Features

- Retrieval from StackExchange-style datasets  
- Vector-based similarity search with **FAISS**  
- Natural language response generation with **LangChain**  
- Modular design for easy extension  

---

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: FAISS, LangChain

ðŸŽ¯ Example Workflow

Preprocess and index StackExchange posts using FAISS

Query the system with a natural language question

Retrieve top relevant posts

Generate a refined response using RAG framework

ðŸš€ Future Improvements

Multi-hop retrieval for more complex queries

Integration with larger pretrained language models

API or Streamlit-based frontend for interactive querying

Source attribution for retrieved answers
